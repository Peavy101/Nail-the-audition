# 🎻 Nail-the-audition 
Nail The Audition is a library of orchestral excerpts as well as an audition list compiler. Users can search for pieces on their upcoming audition list and create a PDF of combined excerpts so that they can easily print their list and get straight to practice

 ## 🎶 Motivation 
Also well as developing software I am a classically trained double bass player. As a double bass player, I would take auditions for orchestras which would entail preparing a list of music set out by the auditioning orchestra. The first step is always to prepare your list of music, and I found it time-consuming to find and organise this music before I could begin practising.

* Library of orchestral parts/excerpts
