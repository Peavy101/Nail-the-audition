 ## Motivation ðŸŽ¶
Also well as developing software I am a classically trained double bass player. As a double bass player, I would take auditions for orchestras which would entail preparing a list of music set out by the auditioning orchestra. The first step is always to prepare your list of music, and I found it time-consuming to find and organise this music before I could begin practising.

## Description ðŸŽ¹
Nail The Audition serves as a library of orchestral excerpts that can be selected, and ordered into a list combined into one PDF for the auditioning musician. The user searches for the pieces, adds them to the list, selects a specific excerpt or full piece, and the website can combine them into one neat PDF for printing.

## Acknowledgements ðŸŒŸ
This project could not have been completed without the help of my Get Coding coach Clark Oake. Thank you Clark for all of your help bringing this website to life!
