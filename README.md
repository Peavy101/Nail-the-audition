 ## Motivation ðŸŽ¶
Also well as developing software I am a classically trained double bass player. As a double bass player, I would take auditions for orchestras which would entail preparing a list of music set out by the auditioning orchestra. The first step is always to prepare your list of music, and I found it time-consuming to find and organise this music before I could begin practising.
